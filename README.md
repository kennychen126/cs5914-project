## Intruduction
The project uses blockchain and prompts to adjust chatgpt so that it can provide more reliable answers based on professional data knowledge.

Chatgptï¼š
The reason we use chatgpt is because llama2 requires sufficient gpu resources. Although we successfully used llama2 locally, the server resources were insufficient and we could only use chatgpt.

Prompts
Adaptation for chatgpt's answer.

Blockchain:
You can create a db through embedding and provide information about the problem.
